# Automobile Price Prediction Notebook

This is a Jupyter Notebook script that I did to compare the performance and effectiveness of a number of machine learning models available in the scikit learn library to predict the prices of automobiles.

The dataset (Automobile_price_data.csv) came from UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile).

After the cleaning and data preparation, the dataset is separated in train and test datasets. 

The trained dataset is used to train the machine learning models available in the scikit learn like Linear Regression, Lars, Lasso and so on.

After the training, the test dataset is used to evaluated the performance of the trained models.

At the end of the execution, it is shown a table with the performance of all models with its effectiveness in predict the price of the automobiles along with the time needed to train the model.

I made this script during my data science studies to serve as a base to compare any number of machine learning models with any dataset.
